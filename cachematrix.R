## This function will take a matrix as an argument and return the inverse of that matrix
## The function will first check to see if the inverse matrix has already been cached
## If the inverse already exists in the cache, the function will read and return it from the cache
## If the inverse is not in the cache, the function will calculate the inverse and store it
## in the cache. 

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
